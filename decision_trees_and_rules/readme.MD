# Identifying Risky Bank Loans Using C5.0 Decision Trees /
# Identifying Poisonous Mushrooms with Rule Learners

Inspired by Brett Lantz's Machine Learning with R, Chapter 5:
Divide and Conquer - Classification Using Decision Trees and Rules.

The original code is made with {C50}, {gmodels}, {OneR} and {RWeka}. I 
wanted to see how one could recreate it using mainly {tidymodels} and
{tidyverse}.
