# Identifying Frequently Purchased Groceries with Association Rules

Inspired by Brett Lantz's Machine Learning with R, Chapter 8: Finding Patterns - Market Basket Analysis Using Association Rules

The original code is made with {arules}. Now, this is an algorithm that isn't found in {tidymodels}. I still wanted to recreate it using {tidyverse} as much as possible. Helps with the readability if nothing else!
