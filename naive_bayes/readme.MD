# Filtering Mobile Phone Spam with Naive Bayes

Inspired by Brett Lantz's Machine Learning with R, Chapter 4: Probabilistic Learning - Classification Using Naive Bayes.

The original code is made with a lot of base R, {e1071} and {gmodels}. I wanted to see how one could recreate it using mainly {tidymodels}, {tidyverse} and {tidytext}.
