# Learning Machine Learning

I'm learning ML with R. Focusing on (but not limiting myself to) tidyverse and tidymodels.

## Algorithms tackled (see the named folder(s) for examples):
* K-nearest neighbors (k-NN)
* Naive Bayes __UPDATED__
* Decision Trees and Rules __UPDATED__
* Regression Methods 
* Neural Networks
* Support Vector Machines
* Association Rules
* Clustering

## Coming up next:
* Hyperparameter Optimization
* Bagging
* Boosting
* Random Forest
