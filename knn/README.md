# Classifying Cancer Samples with K-Nearest Neighbors

Inspired by Brett Lantz's Machine Learning with R, Chapter 3: Lazy Learning - Classification Using Nearest Neighbors.

The original code is made with a lot of base R, {class} and {gmodels}. I wanted to see how one could recreate it using mainly {tidymodels} and {tidyverse}.
