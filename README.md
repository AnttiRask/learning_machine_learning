# Learning Machine Learning

I'm learning machine learning (ML) by reading the book __Machine Learning with R__ by __Brett Lantz__. I've read the 3rd edition (published in 2019) and am currently reading the 4th edition. I will update the repo along the way.

While the book is excellent in explaining the different algorithms used, it still doesn't use tidyverse and tidymodels. Two of the frameworks that make data science -related tasks more user friendly, mainly because of a unified syntax. Obviously I'm not limiting myself to only them, but the whole point of this repo is to offer an alternative to base R and the separate packages used in the book and in the [official GitHub repo](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Machine-Learning-with-R-Fourth-Edition).

## Disclaimer!
This repo is not meant to replace the book in any way. You should definitely read the book. It will help you understand ML in general (and specifically with R) much better than looking at the code alone.

Also, I would recommend you buy the book. Here's a direct [link](https://www.packtpub.com/product/machine-learning-with-r-fourth-edition/9781801071321) to __Packt__'s (the publisher) website.
