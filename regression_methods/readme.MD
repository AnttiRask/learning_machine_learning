# Predicting Medical Expenses with Linear Regression /
# Estimating Wine Quality with Regression Trees and Model Trees

Inspired by Brett Lantz's Machine Learning with R, Chapter 6:
Forecasting Numeric Data - Regression Methods.

The original code is made with {psych}, {rpart}, {rpart.plot} and {Cubist}. I wanted to see how one could recreate it using mainly {tidymodels}, {tidyverse} and {rules}.
