# Modeling the Strength of Concrete with Neural Networks

Inspired by Brett Lantz's Machine Learning with R, Chapter 7: Black Box Methods - Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines.

The original code is made with {neuralnet}. I wanted to see how one could recreate it using mainly {tidymodels} and {tidyverse}.
